ABSTRACT OF STEGANOGRAPHY:

INDRODUCTION:
          
         Image steganography is the process of hiding secret data or messages within an image in such a way that it is not easily perceptible to the human eye.
         
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

             * TO FIND THE CRIME COMMITTED IN A CITY,AND THE POLICE HAVE RETRIEVED SOME JPEG FILES FROM THE CRIME SCENE.
             * NOW, THE POLICE NEED TO FIND THE REASON BEHIND THE CRIME FROM THE EVIDENCE THEY GOT


USE CASE:
        
           * The use case used in this project is digital forensics,In digital forensics, image steganography can be used as a tool for investigating crimes. Criminals may use image steganography to hide incriminating evidence or to communicate secretly with others. Digital forensic investigators can use steganalysis techniques to detect the presence of hidden data within digital images and extract the hidden information for use as evidence.
           * These techniques can be applied to a wide range of image file formats, including JPEG, BMP, PNG, and GIF.
           *  Digital forensic investigators must stay up-to-date with the latest steganography techniques and steganalysis tools to effectively investigate crimes and bring criminals to justice.
           
           
 KEYS USED IN THE PROJECT:
              
               * Secret Key: In symmetric-key cryptography, a secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the information. The same key is used to hide and retrieve the hidden information in the image. 
              
 ALGORITHM USED HERE:
           
           * Secret Key: In symmetric-key cryptography, a secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt the information. The same key is used to hide and retrieve the hidden information in the image.
