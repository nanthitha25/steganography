# steganography



INDRODUCTION:
       
       
            Image steganography is the process of hiding secret data or messages within an image in such a way that it is not easily perceptible to the human eye.

 for image steganography we can use still imagery.
                          
                          
                          The most widely used technique today is hiding of secret messages into a digital
                          image. This steganography technique exploits the weakness of the human visual
                          system (HVS). HVS cannot detect the variation in luminance of color vectors at
                          higher frequency side of the visual spectrum. A picture can be represented by a
                          collection of color pixels. The individual pixels can be represented by their optical
                          characteristics like 'brightness', 'chroma' etc. Each of these characteristics can be
                          digitally expressed in terms of 1s and 0s.
                            
                           For example: a 24-bit bitmap will have 8 bits, representing each of the threecolor values (red, green, and blue) at each pixel. If we consider just the blueIf we consider just the blue there will be 28 different values of blue. The difference between 11111111 and 11111110 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by thehuman eye. Hence, if the terminal recipient of the data is nothing but human visual system (HVS) then the Least Significant Bit (LSB) can be used forsomething else other than color information.
                           
                           
                           This technique can be directly applied on digital image in bitmap format as well
as for the compressed image format like JPEG. In JPEG format, each pixel of the
image is digitally coded using discrete cosine transformation (DCT). The LSB of
encoded DCT components can be used as the carriers of the hidden message

use case of steganography:

              < Confidential Communication:used to send confidential messages,images,or other digital files


                          < Digital Watermarking:used to embed invisible digital watermarks in images, which can be used to identify the copyright owner or to prevent unauthorized use of the image.


                          < Covert Operations: used by intelligence agencies or military organizations to communicate covertly, without attracting attention or raising suspicion.

     
                          < Personal Privacy:used by individuals to protect their personal privacy.


                          < Digital Forensics: used in digital forensics, where investigators use it to detect the presence of hidden messages or files in images as part of their investigations.
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
 CONCLUSION:

          In conclusion, image steganography is a technique for hiding secret data within an image in such a way that it remains hidden from unauthorized viewers. It is a popular method for secure communication, digital watermarking, and copyright protection. By altering the pixel values or other characteristics of an image, hidden information can be embedded within the image while maintaining its overall appearance
