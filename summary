Image steganography hides secret data within an image without noticeable visual changes.
Common methods include Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion, which modifies the least
significant bits of pixel values, and LSB matching, which slightly alters pixel values
to match secret data, both offering simplicity but being vulnerable to detection and
modifications. More robust techniques like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT),
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) embed data
in the image's frequency domain, enhancing resistance to image processing at the
cost of higher complexity. Spread spectrum techniques distribute data using
pseudorandom noise patterns for high security, while adaptive steganography adjusts
embedding based on image content for better imperceptibility. The choice of method depends
on the desired balance of security, robustness, and computational efficiency.
